Hermes iOS is a self-hosted-first iPhone companion for a user-owned Hermes runtime. It adds a native iOS app, a public relay, and a host-side connector so Hermes can move between desktop, phone, sensors, widgets, and voice without turning your runtime into a hosted service.

## Why use it

- **Self-hosted first**: the relay is yours, the connector runs next to your Hermes install, and the iPhone app can point to any compatible relay.
- **Native iPhone + iPad experience**: chat, voice mode, camera attachments, widgets, Live Activities, sensor-aware context. iPad gets a native sidebar layout with NavigationSplitView.
- **Hermes-aware**: slash commands, installed skills, personalities, quick commands, MCP-backed context, and agent-side coding workflows.
- **Optional platform extras**: APNs and CarPlay are supported, but not required to get a working setup.

## What works today

- Streaming chat with retries, attachments, inline diffs, markdown/code blocks, and inline returned images
- Voice mode with OpenAI Realtime, live camera context, and Hermes tool delegation
- Dynamic slash-command catalog sourced from Hermes built-ins, installed skills, personalities, and quick-command metadata
- Health, location, motion, and sensor storage through the connector SQLite pipeline
- Home Screen widgets, Live Activities, and host/model/context status in the chat UI
- Self-hosted relay + connector pairing flow with background service support

## Sensor Pipeline & MCP Tools

The connector continuously receives sensor data from your iPhone and stores it locally in SQLite on your Hermes machine. Hermes accesses this data through MCP tools — meaning your agent can answer questions about you, build on top of your personal data, and use it as context in any conversation.

**What flows from your phone:**
- Real-time GPS location with reverse-geocoded addresses
- 11 HealthKit metrics (steps, heart rate, sleep, calories, blood oxygen, and more)
- CoreMotion activity detection (walking, running, driving, cycling, stationary)

**What your agent can do with it:**

```
You:    "Find me a good dinner spot tonight"
Hermes: Looks like you've been around the West Village today. Carbone, Via
        Carota, and L'Artusi are all nearby and well-reviewed. Carbone usually
        needs a reservation — want me to look into availability?

You:    "Am I on track for my fitness goals this week?"
Hermes: You've hit 42,000 steps so far this week (avg 8,400/day), burned
        2,100 active calories, and averaged 7.1 hours of sleep. Your
        resting heart rate has been steady at 62 bpm. You're ahead on
        steps but slightly behind on sleep — you lost about an hour
        last night compared to your weekly average.

You:    "Build me a personal health dashboard"
Hermes: I'll query your sensor database and create an interactive dashboard
        with your steps, sleep trends, heart rate, and location history
        over the past 30 days. Give me a minute.
```

The data never leaves your machine. The sensor SQLite database lives at `~/.hermes-mobile/sensors.db` and is queryable through the `hermes_mobile` MCP server with 8 tools:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `get_user_location` | Current location with address |
| `get_location_history` | Where you've been (time-series) |
| `get_health_summary` | All latest health metrics at once |
| `get_health_metric` | Time-series for one metric |
| `get_health_metrics_list` | Available metrics + latest values |
| `get_user_activity` | Current physical activity |
| `get_sensor_schema` | Database table definitions |
| `query_sensor_data` | Custom read-only SQL queries |

The `query_sensor_data` tool is particularly powerful — your agent can write arbitrary SELECT queries against your health and location data to find correlations, build charts, generate reports, or power any project that benefits from personal sensor data.

> [!TIP]
> Install the bundled `hermes-ios` skill (see step 5 below) to teach Hermes when and how to use these tools effectively.

## Architecture

The relay is the control plane. In connector mode, Hermes execution stays on the user-owned machine where the connector is installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you test on a physical iPhone against a local relay, use your Mac's LAN IP or a public URL. Do **not** use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`; on a phone those point back to the phone itself.

## Quick start

### 1. Run the relay

```bash
cd relay
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
cp .env.example .env
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

For a production-style setup, see [relay/README.md](relay/README.md) and [relay/docs/fly-io.md](relay/docs/fly-io.md).

### 2. Install and set up the connector

```bash
cd connector
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]

export HERMES_COMMAND=/absolute/path/to/hermes
export HERMES_MOBILE_RELAY_URL=https://your-relay.example.com/v1

hermes-mobile setup
```

The setup wizard can:

- use an existing relay URL
- guide you through a Fly.io relay deployment
- register the local `hermes_mobile` MCP server
- configure OpenAI Realtime talk mode
- install the connector background service

See [connector/README.md](connector/README.md) for the full flow.

### 3. Build and open the iPhone app

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Set your signing team and local bundle/App Group overrides if needed.
3. Launch the app on your phone or simulator.
4. Enter the same relay URL used by the connector.

<insert image> Connect Hermes screen with a custom relay URL entered and the phone pairing code ready to scan.

### 4. Pair the phone

On the connector host:

```bash
hermes-mobile pair-phone
```

Then scan the QR code or enter the manual code in the iPhone app.

### 5. Recommended: install the Hermes iOS skill in Hermes

The connector exposes the `hermes_mobile` MCP tools, but the bundled `hermes-ios` skill teaches Hermes when and how to use them well for location, health, activity, and sensor-aware responses.

From the repo root:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.hermes/skills
cp -R skills/hermes-ios ~/.hermes/skills/
```

If you are updating an older local copy of the skill, replace it explicitly:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.hermes/skills/hermes-ios
cp -R skills/hermes-ios ~/.hermes/skills/
```

Then reload Hermes:

```text
/reload-mcp
```

Or start a fresh Hermes chat/session if you prefer.

## Optional features

> [!TIP]
> You do not need APNs or CarPlay to get a working setup. They are additive features.

- **APNs**: lets the relay deliver Hermes replies while the app is backgrounded. Setup lives in [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).
- **CarPlay**: requires Apple approval for the voice-based conversational entitlement. It is optional and inert when not configured.


## iPad Support

Hermes iOS adapts to iPad with a native sidebar layout:

- **NavigationSplitView** with a persistent sidebar on the left
- Sections: Chat, Inbox, Talk, Settings
- Offline indicator (orange dot) next to Chat when Hermes is disconnected
- Sidebar selection drives the detail pane
- iPhone keeps the existing tab bar layout unchanged

The root view auto-detects the device class and renders the appropriate layout. No configuration needed.

### Building for iPad

The branch `feat/ipad-layout` contains the iPad layout work:

1. Clone the repo and check out `feat/ipad-layout`
2. Open `HermesMobile.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on an iPad simulator or device
4. For sideloading: build for device, package as .ipa, install via SideStore

No API keys or signing certificates required for development builds.

## Project status

Hermes iOS is already usable as a self-hosted project, but it is still actively evolving. The public docs are optimized for getting a new user from clone to first paired chat as quickly as possible; the maintainer docs track deeper capability and architecture details.
